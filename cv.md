### **About me**
My name is Anastasia. I am an architect by education. I have worked as an architect and designer for several years. BUT one day I accidentally found out about the IT field, or rather about web development. And I decided to try myself in a new field of activity. Since in the process of self-study I realized that I want to be realized as a frontend developer. since this kind of activity is very interesting.
